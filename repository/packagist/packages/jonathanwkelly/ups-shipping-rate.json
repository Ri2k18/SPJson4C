Basically, you pass it the shipping method you'd like to use, the destination \/ shipper zip codes, the package dimensions, and receive a shipping quote. There are plenty of values that are hard-coded in the XML request that could be passed in dynamically for a more robust rating process.","keywords":["api","shipping","ups","Rate"],"homepage":"","version":"dev-master","version_normalized":"9999999-dev","license":["unknown"],"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan W.
